### Hello!

I'm Raymond Camden, a developer out of Lafayette, Louisiana. I'm married with eight kids (yes, you read that right). I've been in development for nearly forty years, having started off by hacking on an Apple 2 as a kid and than moving on to web development in the early 90s.

A lot of the first part my career was heavily involved with ColdFusion. I worked on many open source projects in the language and was active in the community for probably close to fifteen years. 

Since then I'm moved away from ColdFusion and have turned most of my focus to JavaScript. I love working on the web in general, but lately have been mostly involved with Vue.js, the Jamstack, and serverless. 

If you want to find out more about me, check out my [blog](https://www.raymondcamden.com) or follow me on Twitter ([@raymondcamden](https://twitter.com/raymondcamden)). 

I love to help peoeple, so please reach out if you have questions. My DMs are open on Twitter and you can email me at my blog. Also, my two favorite things are Star Wars and cats, not necessarily in that order.
